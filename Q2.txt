2. OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT

In JavaScript almost everything is an "OBJECT". Object is an type of non-primitive data type in JavaScript which is used to represent instance through which 
we can access members.

In simple terms, A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behaviour.

The name:value pairs represent the properties of an object. For example, if we consider an object Apple, we have its properties like:

    1. Type: Fruit
    2. Outer Colour: Red
    3. Inner Colour: White
    4. Taste: Sweet             etc.....

An object method is an object property containing a function definition.

The syntax for adding a property to an object is :

            ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;

The object properties can be different primitive values, other objects and functions.

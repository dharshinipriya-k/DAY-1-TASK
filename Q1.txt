1. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP 1.1 VS HTTP2

HTTP 1.1

    ** First usable version of HTTP.

    ** Comparatively slower than HTTP2

    ** It works on textual format i.e, it transfers all the requests and responses in the plain text form.

    ** It loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.

    

HTTP 2

    ** A new version of HTTP from the previous one.

    ** Faster and efficient than HTTP 1.1.

    ** It works on the binary protocol i.e, instead of textual messages, it converts all the messages in binary format which is more compact and saves bandwith.

    ** It is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that none of the resource blocks any other resources.
